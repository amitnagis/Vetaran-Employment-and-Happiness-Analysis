On December 10th, 2016, few people came together for a hackathon
sponsored by Immuta, College Park. The hackathon was a part of an
effort  by the non-profit, America’s Warrior Partnership
(http://www.americaswarriorpartnership.org), which is responsible
for collection and maintenance of veteran records and aides in
resolving specific issues faced by the veterans, to discover
various ways by which they can identify and resolve veteran issues
based on a better understanding of their database.

Participants worked individually and in groups, to understand the
cause and the pattern of veteran unemployment, educations status,
quality of life, health etc. I looked at the employment database
to figure if causes of employment can be identified and addressed.
The employment database included the individual veteran id’s and
results of two surveys performed few years apart (>5, however the
exact number of intervening years was not known to the AWP representatives for certain).
The two surveys asked the same question to the participating veterans:
to state their current employment status. The participants were to choose
from one of the five options only (these options were kept the same for the two surveys):
Employed, Unemployed, Unable to work, Retired, Full-time student.
I wanted to know how the participants status changed overtime
and how their previous status was correlated to their present
status. So I selected those veterans who had
participated in both the surveys. Unfortunately, there were few
databases that had been linked to this which disallowed me to
draw any links between the veteran employment status and their
age, number of service tours or health status. The findings were
presented the following day to AWP representatives. It turned out
that the ability to enroll in school ,full-time when faced with
unemployment was an extremely good predictor for future employment.
The findings are in the pdf: VeteranEmployment.pdf.

Within the same time I was involved in another small exploration
in a group of three. We wanted to understand, what were the good
predictors for certain quality of life questions. We specifically
targeted the response to the question whether they felt they were,
‘able to adapt to change’ in their lifestyle after leaving active
duty. The responses were to be chosen from either: Strongly
Agree, Agree, Unsure, Disagree, Strongly Disagree. We used
F-test to find top 20 predictors for various responses and
well these predictors performed. I, being the least experienced
member of the group was mostly involved with data cleaning and
 generating the appropriate data frames in pandas and
 suggesting ways to help improve data collection for future
 purposes. The report was presented the following day and can 
 be accessed in the repo: PedictorsForHappiness.pdf.
